**Check Vero** is a decentralized verification protocol for real-time communication – starting with phone calls.

In a world of AI voice scams and deepfake messages, Check Vero verifies the **signal**, not just the sender.

---

## 🔍 Use Case

– Real-time caller verification (banks, governments, platforms)  
– AI-assisted risk & intent analysis  
– Signal-staking via the $VERO token  
– Originally submitted as a 15K DFINITY grant proposal (not awarded)  
– Now reapplying for 25K with improved MVP and real-world validation  
– Pilot commitment secured with Dutch bank (Australia branch): customers will receive email invitation to test the app  
– Public subsidy in preparation via awareness programs in both the Netherlands 🇳🇱 and Australia 🇦🇺

---

## 🧱 Built on Internet Computer (ICP)

– ✅ Modular canister-based architecture  
– ✅ Plug Wallet integration (used in early PoC)  
– ✅ Oisy Wallet integration planned for production  
– ✅ Internet Identity compatible  
– ✅ Fully open-source and trustless by design

## 📜 Background

A previous DFINITY grant application (15K tier) was submitted with a full milestone plan.  
Although not selected (likely due to tier fit), we’ve since refined the project and are reapplying for the **25K tier** with a sharper technical focus.

This submission represents a mission-driven prototype — combining:

– Clear technical architecture  
– A working brand + ecosystem vision  
– Real-world pilot alignment

## 🛠️ MVP Technical Overview (Hackathon Submission)

This MVP simulates real-time phone number verification using a Motoko backend + HTML frontend.

**Structure**
- `main.mo`: Motoko backend that verifies known phone numbers (2 entries + fallback warning)
- `index.html`: Simple UI with input field and `verify` button
- Uses `Oisy Wallet` (planned) for identity-based access

**Frontend Preview**
- [✅ checkvero.com](https://checkvero.com)
- Hosted via Fleek on Internet Computer Protocol

**Deployment**
- `dfx.json` defines frontend/backend structure
- Fleek auto-deploy from GitHub (via `/src/check_vero_frontend` as publish path)
